# Mortality_By_Meat_Consumption

## Summary:
By combining the CDC's data on deaths from unintentional poisoning (2000 - 2015) with OECD's data on meat consumption (1990 - 2029) by country we investigated a correlation between the amount of meat a country consumed and the number of fatalities attributed to unintentional poisoning.

## Data Sources (Extract)

### Unintentional poisoning

### Meat Consumption

## Preprocessing (Transform)

## Storage (Load)

## Analysis

## Findings

## (bonus Predictive analysis using machine learning)

## To Do 10/10/2021
Outline the structure of the new Read Me file which should:
- Provide background on our data sources "CDC unintentional poisoning" (look for a more recent dataset if possible) ; "OECD's meat consumption"
- Identify the key features present in our datasets (Preprocessing)
- Summarize the cleaning process used to clean and consolidate our data (Preprocessing)
- Summarize the creation of PostgresSQL database using SQL alchemy
- Explain the questions that drove the investigation and the insights we were able to extract once we visualized using Tableau
- Summarize the key insights from the analysis 
- (Bonus) How can we implement machine learing in this project?
