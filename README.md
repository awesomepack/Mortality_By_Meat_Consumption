## To Do 10/10/2021
Outline the structure of the new Read Me file which should:
- Provide background on our data sources "CDC unintentional poisoning" (look for a more recent dataset if possible) ; "OECD's meat consumption"
- Identify the key features present in our datasets (Preprocessing)
- Summarize the cleaning process used to clean and consolidate our data (Preprocessing)
- Summarize the creation of PostgresSQL database using SQL alchemy
- Explain the questions that drove the investigation and the insights we were able to extract once we visualized using Tableau
- Summarize the key insights from the analysis 
- (Bonus) How can we implement machine learing in this project?
