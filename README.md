# Project Scope
The CDC is questioning the lethality of meat. They have hired us to see if we can use data housed in their Mortality Database to find any correlation between a country's consumption of meat and the number of deaths it reports.

## Summary:
In this project we establish an ETL workflow in which we:
* Use the scope of our project to define data sources
* Transform the data into an intuitive schema
* Upload our processed data into our target RDS

Please Proceed into the [ETL](https://github.com/awesomepack/Mortality_By_Meat_Consumption/tree/main/ETL) Folder for more details.
